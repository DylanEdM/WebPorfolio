										<h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Importance of professional behaviour as a student</h2>
									<p>
										As a student, it is important to maintain a professional profile as it may give rise to opportunities at any time whether its meeting
										potential employers, clients, or gaining the respect of colleagues.<br>
										Characteristics that are becoming of professional behaviour is:
										<ul>
											<li>Integrity</li>
											<li>Organisation</li>
											<li>Time-management</li>
											<li>Respectful</li>
											<li>Curious</li>
											<li>Humble</li>
											<li>Considerate</li>
											<li>Appropriate use of language</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										Professional behaviour is important specifically in IT to building trust, ensuring we are operating at the highest quality and that
										we can be sure we are following industry standards at a minimum.
									</p>
									
									<hr class="major"/>
									<h2>Impact of unprofessional behaviour</h2>
									<p>
										The impact of unprofessional behaviour is the loss of trust, responsibility, credentials and in extreme cases, your job, career, clients
										and other opportunities.<br>
										The impact on others is loss of time, loss of work, feeling of invalidation and missed opportunity. When everyone is professional we can
										excel with the highest standards, productivity and bring meaningful results.
									</p>

									<h2>Professional behaviours relevant to my future career</h2>
									<em><strong>
										See BCS Code of Conduct <a href='https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/'  target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab" >here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
									</strong></em><br>

									<h3>Public Interest</h3>
									<p>
										As a cyber security professional I have the ability to protect and safeguard but such
										responsibilities come with Knowledge and skills that can do harm either intentionally or
										not. As a professional I must do what I need to ensure that I have the public interest at heart.
										This means I must:
										<ul>
											<li>"have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment;"</li>
											<li>"have due regard for the legitimate rights of third parties;"</li>
											<li>"conduct your professional activities without discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, marital
												 status, nationality, colour, race, ethnic origin, religion, age or disability, or of any other condition or requirement;"
											</li>
											<li>"promote equal access to the benefits of IT and seek to promote the inclusion of all sectors in society wherever opportunities arise."</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3>Professional Competence and Integrity</h3>
									<p>
										No one know everything, it my duty to ensure I know the limits of my knowledge and abilities. I must ensure
										I am curious and humble enough to continue learning; this is never more important then in cyber security where
										threat actors continue to develop themselves and we need to defend against them. Furthermore, knowing your limits
										allows you to ensure that responsibilities that when neglected would do harm, you are certain you can carry them out.
										Additionally, given our potentially privileged positions, we must reject unethical bribery or unethical inducement.
									</p>

									<h3>Duty to relevant authority</h3>
									<p>
										We have a duty to our authority, to act in it's best interest. This may because undue and unintended harm may come from
										rejecting this duty. Particularly in security we will be working for an organisation that has it's own responsibilities to protect
										people, assets or data that if compromised will bring significant harm.
									</p>

									<h3>Duty to the profession</h3>
									<p>
										I am very fascinated by digital technology and sharing it with all which is my way of advancing the profession.
										By sharing the profession we can uphold the reputation and positive standing of the cyber security and BCS while encouraging professional
										development.
									</p>

									<h2>History of professional behaviour</h2>
									<p>
										I haven't had the best history of professional behaviour sometimes using language not appropriate in anyway let alone in the workplace.
										Since then however I have developed significantly. Consider my current <a href="2skills.html" target="_self" title="Opens in this tab">skills</a>
										or the <a href="3development.html" target="_self" title="Opens in this tab">development</a> I have done.
