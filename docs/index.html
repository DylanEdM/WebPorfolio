											<h1>Introduction</h1>
											<p>Learn about my career objectives, professional profile and skills</p>

											I have previous industry experience in software development, this means I'm well equipped for creating software particularly in web development.
											Some examples include AWS, PostgreSQL, Atlassian suite as well as stakeholder management. See more <a href="2skills.html">Skills</a>.
										</p>
										<p>
											I'm currently studying Cyber Security to obtain the degree and hopefully pick up some certifications along the way. I have always enjoyed the creative
											but methodical process of interrogating systems, networks and code which is why I chose this path. I have also enjoyed working in teams and being a leader.
											This is most seen through my current work on student Union Elections and being the School of Science and Technology undergrad student representative responsible 
											for 116 individual representatives. See more <a href="3development.html">Knowledge and Skills Development</a>.
										</p>
										<P>
											I wish to return to the civil service particularly in law enforcement however that is unlikely. My aspiration of becoming a director will not be effected as I can choose to
											do an MBA instead of the civil service Senior Leaders Scheme or Directors Leadership Programme. Outside of prestige, I want to be in a position that allows me to posivitely
											impact peoples lives. Personal aspirations such as marriage, children and sportsmanship will have to be balanced against these lofty goals.<br>
