										<h1>Analysis and Evidence of Own Skills&nbsp;</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>
										I have previous industry experience in software development, this means I'm well equipped for creating software
										particularly in web development. Some examples include AWS, PostgreSQL, Atlassian suite as well as stakeholder management.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Leadership</h2>
									<p>
										I have many experiences of leadership. My most recent examples is my School officer role and System Analysis and Design coursework
										where I was the team lead.
									</p>

									<h3>Team lead</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/TeamLeadEvidence.png" alt="evidence of team lead" /></span>
									<p>
										I led my team in System Analysis & Design, delegating tasks and using an agile approach with components of extreme programming.
										Through this I had the opportunity to mentor my team in UX/UI principals such as accessibility using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
										database design through understanding entity relational vs flat file vs document based design paradigms. I weighed project work vs the needs
										of the team, for example, a team member had to take some personal time and I re-delineated work to accommodate this. Being a leader is more
										than just organising; it's handling people and communicating with grace, it's teaching not just doing it yourself that allows the team to perform
										exceptionally, it's ensuring everyone understands the vision, goal and their responsibilities.
									</p>

									<h3>School Officer</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/schoolOfficerOfTheYear.jpg" alt="evidence of school officer of the year" /></span>
									<p>
										As school officer, I organised a few events for course reps to share concerns as well as socialize. I also led some of the focus groups in school forums
										collecting feedback on school issues such as technology, teaching quality, course content, timetabling and etc. Furthermore, I helped students with issues
										including, after a meeting with the student, I was able to to share their concerns with the course leader and promptly arranged a sit down between the two.
										I won School Officer of the Year 2025!
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Governance</h2>
									<h3>The Elections Committee</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/ElectionCommittee.jpg" alt="Elections Committee evidence" /></span>
									<p>
										My experience of governance most recently is through my Elections Committee work. Understanding the Student Union code and translating that over
										to election regulation where the rules for how the election is run are written decided by us. Meeting legal obligations such as those under the
										Education Act 1996 and Education Act 2011, deciding complaints process and considering implications on different demographics where important too.
										Act of governance truly shone through when the Election Committee decided that we would remove the segregation between digital and in-person
										campaigning and when we had to interpret the regulation to justly respond to a complaint with serious ramifications on the election.
									</p>

									<h2>DevSecOps</h2>
									<p>
										Majority of evidence for technical skills can be found through my various repositories and contribution through
										<a href="https://olympus.ntu.ac.uk/N1215034" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">git<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
