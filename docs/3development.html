									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>
										I'm currently studying Cyber Security to obtain the degree and hopefully pick up some certifications along the way. I have always enjoyed the creative
										but methodical process of interrogating systems, networks and code which is why I chose this path. I have also enjoyed working in teams and being a leader.
										This is most seen through my current work on student Union Elections and being the School of Science and Technology undergrad student representative responsible 
										for 116 individual representatives.

									<p>CIE Mandatory workshops are Mandatory workshops for first-years at the university with the aim to explore primarily sexual consent and handling disclosures.</p>

												I learnt about octal notation to set permissions. Example includes 754 and permissions include read(r), write(w) and execute(x) with first part being applied to the owner, next to the group and last applied to others.

												Setting permissions and checking they are correctly set is no easy task with the octal notation at first due to the brain being unfamiliar with the patterns. With practice, it will become second nature and handy tool.

												I was a able to submit a load of questions for the Q&A with one answered which was the proportion of portfolio (projects) vs qualifications
												on a CV and how are they valued by employers. I was also able to talk to the guest on the way out to discuss the value of qualifications over time.
												Do they become outdated? His response was that if you could continuous development it would still mean a lot due to showcasing your wide ranging knowledge

												Learning about design principles and mapping out how the user interacts with your system is more than focusing on the solution your creating but

											</th>
											<th>
												The lecture covered design of the technical solution but not just from a UI perspective or even a UX perspective but from a life cycle perspective.
												This was very insightful when considering entry points or endpoints of your solution when designing the internals. I suppose the most well not example
												is search engine optimisation where you construct your website to particularly findable in search engines as you expect your customer base will be expecting
												to find you there.

												We had to create instructions for how to build a plane that were clear and concise as possible. I took away how nuanced the english language is.
												Consider your understanding of words and context is entirely dependent on personal experience and inner model of the world that when someone 
												interprets your instructions they may find there inner model tells them what you said was to do x thing so while not wrong, it's just different.
												Also, technically, during the course of the workshop, the assumption was made everyone reads left to right but some languages like Arabic or Hebrew
												are right to left. Furthermore some languages are language by definition others are script. This may make a difference to design of the technical solution
												this is called localisation.

												The guest speaker walked us through the design considerations, project planning and architecture involved with creating the NHS app.
												We were able to see real world experience of what happens when things go wrong on a security front, we learnt how an organisation plans for and
												reacts to breaches and incidents. I noticed in the architecture diagram something called "Oracle Hypervisior", I never got the opportunity to ask 
												about that. I assume that is what they used to connect up legacy systems with the inner NHS network. Also, after the fact I researched NHS Digital
